To run the project, enter 'npm run dev' in the terminal.
If this does not work, delete node_modules folder, and
enter 'npm install' in the terminal. After the installation,
repeat line 1.

Also make sure you have a browser installed that can run WebGL
applications.

Once the app is running, you can select an object in the scene,
by clicking on it. Note: only buildings or points on the ground
can be selected. Once selected, you can do multiple actions,
either through keys or buttons in the GUI.

In the top right corner sits the GUI. From there you get some
information on the key controlls and also get some buttons you
can click on.

Good luck, have fun :)
